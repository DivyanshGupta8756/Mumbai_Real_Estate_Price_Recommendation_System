## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
   - Processed Mumbai housing dataset containing location, area, configuration, and pricing attributes  
   - Handled missing values, categorical variables, and outliers  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed price variations across locations  
   - Studied relationships between area, BHK configuration, and price  
   - Identified dominant pricing drivers in Mumbai’s residential market  

3. **Price Prediction Model**
   - Trained machine learning regression models to estimate flat prices  
   - Evaluated model performance using standard error metrics  

4. **Recommendation System**
   - Implemented a similarity-based recommendation approach  
   - Suggested properties aligned with user-selected budget, location, and configuration
